1. List the symbols for each of the below Javascript operators
    Arithmetic Operators
    Assignment Operators
    Comparison Operators
    Logical Operators
    Bitwise Operators

2. For each JavaScript Operator, write 2 examples.

4. What is the result when the following program is executed?
for (let i = 1; i < 20; i += 7){
    console.log(i)
} 


// Answer to question 1

i. Arithmetic Operators- symbols are +, -, /, *, **, %, ++, --.
ii. Assignment Operators- symbol is =.
iii. Comparison Operators- symbols are >, <, >=, <=, ==, ===, !==.
iv. Logical Operators- symbols are &&, ||, !.
v. Bitwise Operators- symbols are &, |, ^, <<, >>.

// Answer to question 2

1. Arithmetic Operators- 
    i. let a = 6;
       let b = 10;
       console.log(a + b)

    ii. let a = 9;
       let c = 14;
       console.log(a * c)

2. Assignment Operators-
    i. x = 5;
    ii. y = 7;

3. Comparison Operators-
    i. let y = 7;
        let f = "7";
        console.log(y == f) // will return true
    ii. let x = "NaN"
        console.log(x == 0) // will return true because NaN and 0 are falsy values.

4. Logical Operators-
    i. let mathScore = 22;
         if (mathScore>= 70 && mathScore <= 100) {
          console.log("A1")
    ii. let age = 22;
        let yearsInNigeria = 20;
         if (age >= 18 || yearsInNigeria >= 18){
            console.log("eligible to vote")
         }

5. Bitwise Operators-
    i. age = 10;
       class = 300;
       if (age > 17 & class >= 200) // prints false
    ii. if (age = 18 | class = 300) // prints true

// Answer to question 4
4. The result of the expression below is 1, 8 and 15.
